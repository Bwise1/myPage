         <p >Most people remember me for my smile and sometimes innocent nature.<br> I like to be a good friend to everyone and am kind hearted. I love my family and friends. <br>I work hard, but enjoy relaxing and being spontaneous. I like to say it how it is.<br> I wear uniform mostly during work when I have to, but enjoy my exercise and outdoor clothes <br> the best in the evenings and weekends. I have goals in life and that includes being happy</p>
